# Simple login system for a mock college
> *Also encodes the data in base64*

I was thinking that making a login system might be a fun little chllenge so I decided to make this.
The project will consist of a folder with the txt files for each member and the main file will check 
the data input by the user against the data in the database folder.

# How to use
Step 1. Run the python file\
Step 2. Choose Register or Login and input R for register or L for login in the input area\
Step 3. If you chose Register input the information asked, If you choosed Login input your password and username that you input into your file\
Step 4. If your login is succesful it will say Logged in

# Random things

```Databse/```
This is the directory that stores all the files with the students data inside\
```Docs.txt```
This will include documentation for the project.
